The extension provides a full rendering environment for Handlebars templates
within TYPO3 CMS. All `core features <https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/>`_ of
Handlebars.js are supported by the usage of the third-party library
`LightnCandy <https://github.com/zordius/lightncandy>`_.

Its main use is to seamlessly integrate Handlebars templates into TYPO3 without
the need to modify these templates again for output in TYPO3.
